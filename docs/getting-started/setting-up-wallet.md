# Setting Up Your Wallet (The Key to postfun)

## Your Nostr Key is Your Identity

`postfun` uses the Nostr protocol for identity, so a Nostr key (`nsec`) is your password and identity in one. This gives you complete ownership of your identity without relying on centralized services.

## Installing the postfun Chrome Extension

The easiest and most secure way to use postfun is with our official Chrome Extension. Here's how to get started:

1. Go to the Chrome Web Store and install the `postfun` extension
2. Click the extension icon and choose "Create New Wallet"
3. **BACKUP YOUR PRIVATE KEY**: Write down your `nsec` key and store it somewhere safe. **WARNING: If you lose this key, you lose your funds forever. We cannot recover it for you.**
4. After backing up your key, you'll see your main wallet view with your `npub` (public address)

Your `npub` is what others will see when you interact with the platform, while your `nsec` stays securely stored in the extension and is never shared with our servers.
