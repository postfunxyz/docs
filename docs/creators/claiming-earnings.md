# How to Claim Your Earnings: Unlocking Your Content's Value

## Securely Linking Your Account: Proving Ownership Without Compromise

As a content creator, you automatically earn a share of every trade on any `postfun` Content Pool created from your tweets. To claim these earnings and receive your special Graduation Bonus, you first need to securely link your X (Twitter) account to your `postfun` Nostr identity.

We understand that security and privacy are paramount for creators. That's why `postfun` uses a cutting-edge, privacy-preserving technology called **TLS Notary**. This allows you to cryptographically prove to our backend that you are the legitimate owner of your X account, **without ever sharing your password, cookies, or any sensitive login credentials with us.**

### Why TLS Notary is Essential:
*   **Privacy First:** Your X login details remain entirely private and are never transmitted to `postfun` servers.
*   **Non-Custodial Proof:** You generate a cryptographic "receipt" directly from your browser, which our system can verify.
*   **Trust-Minimized:** It removes the need for `postfun` to act as a trusted third party in the identity verification process.

## The Secure Claiming Process: Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps carefully to link your account and claim the value your content has generated:

1.  **Navigate to Your User Page:**
    *   Open your web browser and go to `https://postfun.xyz/user/<your_twitter_username>`. Replace `<your_twitter_username>` with your actual X.com handle (e.g., `postfun.xyz/user/elonmusk`).
    *   *(Suggested Visual: Screenshot of a profile page, highlighting the "Claim Earnings" button)*

2.  **Initiate Claim Earnings:**
    *   Once on your profile page, ensure you are logged into `postfun` with your Nostr identity (via the `postfun` extension).
    *   Click the prominent "**Claim Earnings**" button.
    *   A modal will appear, explaining the next steps and the TLS Notary process.

3.  **Generate Proof of Ownership (Using the `postfun` Extension):**
    *   The `postfun` extension is crucial for this step. When prompted by the website, the extension will guide you through generating the TLS Notary proof.
    *   This typically involves opening a new, temporary browser window or tab where you will briefly interact with X.com. The extension will observe this session to cryptographically attest that you are indeed logged into that specific X account.
    *   **Important:** Follow the on-screen instructions precisely. Do not close the temporary window until the proof generation is complete.

4.  **Proof Submission & Verification:**
    *   Once the proof is successfully generated by the extension, it will be automatically submitted to the `postfun` backend.
    *   Our backend will cryptographically validate the proof. This typically takes only a few seconds.

5.  **Secure Account Linking:**
    *   Upon successful verification, your X account is now securely and permanently linked to your `postfun` Nostr wallet. This link is stored in our database, associating your `npub` with your X username.
    *   The "Claim Earnings" button on your profile page will now be active, and your "Earned" balance will be visible.

6.  **Claim Your Sats:**
    *   Click the "**Claim**" button.
    *   All the `sats` accumulated from your content's trading fees and any Graduation Bonuses will be instantly transferred from your designated creator balance to your main `postfun` Lightning wallet balance. These funds are immediately available for trading, deposits, or withdrawals.

This robust and privacy-preserving process ensures that only you, the rightful content creator, can claim the earnings from your viral content, cementing `postfun` as the definitive platform for monetizing social influence.
