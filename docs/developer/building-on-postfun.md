# Building on `postfun`

## The Vision

We believe `postfun` is more than a platform; it's a protocol for cultural value. The public API is the first step towards opening up this protocol for everyone. We invite you to build with us.

## What You Can Build

### Trading Bots
Automate strategies based on social signals, volume, or pool progression.

### Analytics Dashboards
Create custom dashboards to track minter profitability, creator earnings, or the fastest-graduating pools.

### Telegram/Discord Bots
Pipe real-time data like new mints, level-ups, or large swaps into community channels.

### Custom UIs
Build alternative frontends or specialized trading interfaces.

## Getting Access & Fair Use Policy

The public `GET` endpoints are open and available. See our API Reference for details.

Current rate limits apply to all requests. For high-volume use cases or to request an API key for authenticated endpoints, please reach out to our team.
