## Usage Guidelines: Protecting the `postfun` Brand

To ensure the strength and recognition of the `postfun` brand, please adhere to these guidelines.

### **Do:**
*   **Use our logo to link to `https://postfun.xyz`** or to specific pages within the platform.
*   **Maintain adequate clear space** around the logo. This "breathing room" ensures its visibility and impact. (e.g., "The clear space around the logo should be at least X% of the logo's width.")
*   **Use the correct color variations** for light/dark backgrounds to ensure optimal contrast and readability.
*   **Scale the logo proportionally** to avoid distortion.
*   **Use the official color palette** for any UI elements or graphics associated with `postfun`.

### **Don't:**
*   **Alter the colors or proportions of the logo** (unless using the approved light/dark variations).
*   **Rotate, distort, or stretch the logo** in any way.
*   **Place the logo on busy backgrounds** where it loses clarity.
*   **Use the logo as a background element** or overlay it with text.
*   **Create derivative or unofficial versions of the logo** or brand marks.
*   **Use `postfun` in a way that implies endorsement or partnership** without official authorization.

By following these guidelines, you help us maintain a strong, consistent, and trusted brand identity for the `postfun` ecosystem.
