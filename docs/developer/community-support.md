## GitHub (Future): Transparent and Open-Source Development

We are committed to the principles of transparency and open-source development. While the `postfun` platform is currently a closed-source project, we have a strong intention to progressively open-source key parts of our stack in the future.

*   **What to Expect:** This could include our core CPMM logic, worker implementations, API client libraries, or even components of our frontend.
*   **Why Open Source?** We believe open-sourcing will foster greater community trust, enable independent security audits, and empower developers to build even more deeply integrated and innovative tools on `postfun`.

**Stay Tuned:** We will make formal announcements regarding our GitHub repository and open-source initiatives through our Discord and X.com channels.

## Bug Bounty Program: Our Commitment to Security

Security is non-negotiable at `postfun`. We employ rigorous internal testing, code reviews, and industry best practices to protect our platform and your funds. However, we recognize that no system is infallible, and the broader security community is an invaluable asset.

We are establishing a **Bug Bounty Program** to incentivize and reward security researchers who responsibly discover and report vulnerabilities in our platform.

### How to Report a Vulnerability:
*   **Responsible Disclosure:** If you believe you have found a security flaw, please do NOT disclose it publicly.
*   **Contact Us:** Immediately report the vulnerability by sending a detailed email to: `security@postfun.xyz`
*   **Required Information:**
    *   A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
    *   Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    *   Screenshots, video recordings, or code snippets that demonstrate the issue (if applicable).
    *   Your assessment of the potential impact of the vulnerability.
    *   Any proposed mitigations or fixes (optional, but helpful).

We commit to a timely response, transparent communication, and fair rewards for valid, responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities. Your efforts help make `postfun` safer for everyone.
