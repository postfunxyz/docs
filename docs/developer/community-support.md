## GitHub (Future): Driving Open-Source Innovation and Transparency

We are deeply committed to the foundational principles of transparency, auditability, and open-source development that underpin the broader Bitcoin and web3 ecosystems. While the current `postfun` platform components are primarily closed-source, we have a firm strategic commitment to progressively open-source key parts of our stack in the future.

*   **API Client Libraries:** Official libraries (e.g., in Python, JavaScript) to simplify interaction with our API for third-party developers.
*   **Modular Components:** Select frontend components or backend microservices that can serve as building blocks for community projects.
*   **Open-Source `postfun` Relays:** Contributing to the Nostr ecosystem by potentially open-sourcing our own Nostr relay implementations.

### The Value of Open Source for `postfun`:
*   **Greater Community Trust:** Transparent code fosters confidence in the system's fairness and security.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Open-source code allows for broader scrutiny by security researchers, aiding in the discovery and remediation of vulnerabilities.
*   **Empowered Development:** Provides direct access to our codebase, enabling developers to build even more deeply integrated, innovative, and specialized tools on `postfun`.
*   **Education:** Serves as a valuable learning resource for those interested in social finance, Nostr, and Bitcoin L2 development.

**Stay Tuned:** We will make formal announcements regarding our GitHub repository, open-source roadmap, and contribution guidelines through our Discord server and official X.com account. Your contributions will be invaluable.

## Bug Bounty Program: Our Unwavering Commitment to Platform Security

Security is the absolute cornerstone of `postfun`. We employ the most rigorous internal testing procedures, meticulous code reviews, automated security scanning, and adhere to industry-best practices to safeguard our platform and your digital assets. However, we acknowledge that even the most robust systems can have unforeseen vulnerabilities. The global security research community is an indispensable ally in maintaining the highest level of protection.

We are proud to implement a comprehensive **Bug Bounty Program** to proactively incentivize and generously reward security researchers who responsibly discover and report vulnerabilities within the `postfun` platform. Your vigilance directly contributes to a safer environment for all users.

### How to Responsibly Report a Vulnerability:
*   **Critical First Step:** If you believe you have identified a security flaw, it is **absolutely crucial** that you do NOT disclose it publicly. Public disclosure before remediation can put user funds at risk.
*   **Direct Contact:** Immediately report the vulnerability by sending a detailed email to our dedicated security inbox: `security@postfun.xyz`
*   **Information to Include in Your Report:**
    *   A clear, concise, and technical description of the vulnerability.
    *   Precise, step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce the vulnerability.
    *   Screenshots, video recordings, or code snippets that demonstrate the issue (if applicable, these are highly encouraged).
    *   Your assessment of the potential impact of the vulnerability (e.g., "leads to loss of user funds," "allows unauthorized access").
    *   Any proposed mitigations or fixes (optional, but greatly appreciated and can expedite the resolution process).
    *   Your contact information for follow-up questions and bounty payment.

We pledge a timely acknowledgment of your report, transparent communication throughout the validation and remediation process, and fair, competitive rewards for valid, responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities. Your invaluable efforts directly contribute to making `postfun` a more secure and resilient platform for everyone.
