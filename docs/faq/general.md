# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is this gambling?

It's speculative trading rather than gambling. While there is risk involved, postfun is based on the value derived from social content rather than pure chance.

## Can I lose money?

Yes. The value of tokens can go down as well as up. Trading on postfun involves significant risk, and you could lose some or all of your initial capital.

## What are the fees?

postfun uses a tiered fee structure:
- Level 1 (Spark): 10% fee
- Level 2 (Bonfire): 5% fee
- Level 3 (Inferno): 3% fee

Fees are distributed as follows:
- Platform Treasury: 80%
- Content Creator: 15%
- Minter: 5%

## Why do I need the extension?

The extension provides:
- Secure storage of your Nostr private key
- One-click trading on X.com
- Seamless authentication across the platform
- Protection of your funds and identity

## What is Nostr? Why do I need an `nsec`?

Nostr is a decentralized protocol for creating censorship-resistant social networks. Your `nsec` is your private key that serves as your identity and password. It's crucial to keep it safe as we cannot recover it for you.

## What happens if the creator never claims their earnings?

The funds remain in the earmarked wallet indefinitely. Anyone who can prove ownership of the X account can claim the funds at any time.
