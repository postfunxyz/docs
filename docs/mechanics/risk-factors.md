# Risk Factors

## Market Risk

The price of Content Pool tokens is highly volatile and determined by supply and demand. You can lose some or all of your initial capital. This is a high-risk platform.

## Technical Risk

The platform is built on complex software. While audited and tested, bugs or exploits could potentially occur, which could lead to a loss of funds.

## Custodial Risk

The integrated Lightning wallet is custodial. Funds deposited are held by the platform. While we employ security best practices, a compromise of our systems could put these funds at risk. For large amounts, we recommend self-custody.

## Centralization Risk

Many core functions are managed by a centralized backend. Platform downtime will prevent trading, deposits, and withdrawals.
