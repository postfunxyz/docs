# Buying & Selling Tokens

## The Trading Interface

The `TradeWidget` on a `Post Detail` page makes it easy to trade tokens. You can either enter the amount of `sats` you want to spend or the number of `tokens` you want to buy. The other value will calculate automatically.

## Understanding Price Impact

Because `postfun` uses a dynamic pricing curve, larger trades will move the price. The UI will show you the potential impact before you confirm.

## How to Trade

1. Click "Buy" or "Sell" in the trading widget
2. Enter the amount you want to trade
3. Review the details including price impact
4. Approve the transaction in your extension
5. The tokens will appear in your wallet (when buying) or sats will be added to your balance (when selling)
