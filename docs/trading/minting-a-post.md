# How to Mint a Post

## Becoming a Minter

The first person to mint a post becomes the "Minter." As a Minter, you get a special share of fees and a massive bonus if the pool graduates.

## Minting Process

1. Find a tweet on X.com you believe in. Copy its URL
2. Go to `postfun.xyz`
3. Paste the URL into the "Mint a New Pool" box on the home page
4. You'll be taken to the new pool page. A transaction will be prompted to pay the 1,000 sat minting fee
5. Once confirmed, you are the Minter and the first token holder!

## Example

Let's say you see a tweet from a visionary like Balaji Srinivasan predicting a new trend. You believe it's going to be hugely influential. By minting it on `postfun`, you're not just agreeingâ€”you're making a verifiable, financial bet on its importance.
