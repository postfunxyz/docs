Okay, I understand. The strategy is to significantly expand the content of the currently shorter Docusaurus `.md` files, aiming for maximum detail and utility, while leaving the already expanded files untouched. This will contribute towards the overall token goal.

I'll focus on:
*   Adding more background, "why," and "how" details.
*   Including more concrete examples and scenarios.
*   Expanding on potential issues and troubleshooting for the user.
*   Deepening explanations of core concepts where applicable, even if they touch upon areas covered in "Mechanics," but from a user/dev perspective.

Let's expand the remaining shorter files: `docs/faq/general.md`, `docs/extension/command-center.md`, and `docs/developer/community-support.md` (even though it's decent, it can always be richer).

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): Your Guide to `postfun`

Welcome to the `postfun` FAQ! Here, we address the most common questions about our platform, from fundamental concepts to specific operational details. Our goal is to provide clear, comprehensive answers that empower you to navigate the `postfun` ecosystem with confidence.

---

## 1. Is `postfun` gambling? What are the risks?

`postfun` operates as a **speculative trading platform** rather than a gambling platform. While both involve risk and potential gain, the core difference lies in the underlying mechanics and the basis of value.

*   **Gambling:** Typically relies on pure chance (e.g., dice rolls, card draws) where outcomes are independent of market forces or user actions.
*   **`postfun`:** The value of Content Pool tokens is derived from real-world social engagement, cultural relevance, and market dynamics (supply and demand, driven by our CPMM and token burn mechanics). Users are making a financial bet on the *perceived future value or virality* of a piece of content.

**Can I lose money?**
**Yes. Absolutely.** Trading on `postfun` involves **significant risk**, and you could lose some or all of your initial capital. Prices are highly volatile and can fluctuate dramatically based on market sentiment, new content, and the success (or failure) of a pool to reach its next level or graduation. Always trade responsibly and never invest more than you can afford to lose. We strongly encourage you to understand the [CPMM and Price Impact](/docs/advanced/cpmm-price-impact) and the [Platform's Economic Engine](/docs/mechanics/economic-engine) before trading.

---

## 2. What are the fees on `postfun`? How are they distributed?

`postfun` employs a transparent, tiered fee structure that decreases as a Content Pool gains traction and progresses through its levels. This incentivizes participation and volume in more mature markets.

**Swap Fees (Applied to every Buy and Sell transaction):**

*   **Level 1 (Spark):** A **10%** fee is applied to the value of the transaction. This higher initial fee helps to bootstrap the ecosystem.
*   **Level 2 (Bonfire):** Once the pool's real `bitcoin_reserve` reaches 1,000,000 sats, the fee drops to **5%**.
*   **Level 3 (Inferno):** When the `bitcoin_reserve` surpasses 10,000,000 sats, the fee is further reduced to **3%**.
*   **Post-Graduation (DEX Listing):** After a pool graduates and is listed on an external Decentralized Exchange (DEX), `postfun` takes a final, standard **1%** fee for facilitating the initial liquidity provision. Trading fees on the DEX itself will follow the DEX's standard fee structure (typically 0.3% per swap).

**How Fees are Distributed (from the collected fee amount):**

The collected fee from each swap is intelligently distributed to align incentives across the ecosystem:

*   **Platform Treasury:** **80%** of the fee. This portion sustains `postfun`'s operations, funds future development, covers infrastructure costs (including Lightning network routing fees), and contributes to platform-wide initiatives.
*   **Content Creator:** **15%** of the fee. The original author of the tweet automatically earns a direct percentage of every trade on a pool for their content. This is a passive income stream for their social influence.
*   **Minter:** **5%** of the fee. The user who first minted the Content Pool and initiated its market earns a smaller cut of every subsequent trade. This rewards their early foresight and risk-taking.

**Example:**
If a user buys 10,000 `sats` worth of tokens in a Level 1 pool (10% fee):
*   **Total Debit from User:** 10,000 `sats`
*   **Collected Fee (10%):** 1,000 `sats`
*   **Sats for Swap (entering the pool):** 9,000 `sats`
*   **Fee Distribution:**
    *   Platform: 800 `sats` (80% of 1,000)
    *   Content Creator: 150 `sats` (15% of 1,000)
    *   Minter: 50 `sats` (5% of 1,000)

## 3. Why do I need the `postfun` Chrome Extension?

The `postfun` Chrome Extension is much more than just an add-on; it's an integral part of the `postfun` experience and is highly recommended for all users. It provides critical functionality and enhances your security and convenience:

*   **Secure Nostr Private Key Storage:** Your Nostr private key (`nsec`), which is your `postfun` identity, is securely stored *within the extension* on your local device. This means your key never leaves your browser and is never transmitted to `postfun` servers.
*   **One-Click Trading on X.com:** The extension injects `postfun` market data directly onto your X.com timeline and tweet pages. This allows you to view prices and execute trades instantly without ever leaving X.com or switching tabs. This is the core of our "Copilot" feature.
*   **Seamless Authentication:** The extension acts as your `NIP-07` compliant Nostr signer. When `postfun.xyz` requires you to log in or approve a transaction, the extension handles the cryptographic signing securely in the background, only asking for your explicit approval via a popup. This makes logging in fast, secure, and intuitive.
*   **Protection of Funds and Identity:** By managing your `nsec` securely and mediating all cryptographic operations, the extension is a crucial layer in protecting your digital assets and identity.

---

## 4. What is Nostr? Why do I need an `nsec` and `npub`?

**Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays)** is a simple, open, and decentralized protocol designed for creating censorship-resistant global social networks. Unlike traditional social media platforms, Nostr doesn't rely on central servers that can be shut down or censor content.

**Your `nsec` (Nostr Secret Key) and `npub` (Nostr Public Key) are fundamental to your `postfun` identity:**

*   **`nsec` (Private Key):** This is a long string of characters (starting with `nsec1...`). It acts as your **identity, password, and signature key** all in one. It should be kept absolutely secret and secure. Only the `postfun` extension stores this for you locally. If you lose your `nsec`, you lose access to your `postfun` account and funds.
*   **`npub` (Public Key):** This is derived from your `nsec` (starts with `npub1...`). It's what you share with others. It acts as your **public identifier** on `postfun` and other Nostr-powered applications. When you make a trade or link your X.com account, your `npub` is publicly recorded as the actor.

**Why `postfun` uses Nostr:**
*   **Self-Sovereign Identity:** You own your identity, not `postfun`.
*   **Enhanced Security:** All transactions and logins are cryptographically signed by your `nsec` (via the extension), providing strong security.
*   **Future-Proofing:** `postfun` is built on open, decentralized standards, allowing for greater interoperability and resilience.

---

## 5. What happens if the creator never claims their earnings?

This is a common and important question, especially for creators who might not be immediately aware of `postfun`.

*   **Funds are Earmarked:** When a Content Pool generates fees for a creator, these `sats` are automatically moved to a designated `earned_sats` balance associated with that specific X.com username within `postfun`'s backend ledger.
*   **Indefinite Holding:** These funds remain in this earmarked balance indefinitely. They do not expire or get reabsorbed by the platform.
*   **Claim Anytime:** The creator (or anyone who can securely prove ownership of that X.com account via the TLS Notary process) can claim these funds at any time, even years later. Once claimed, they are transferred to the creator's main `postfun` Lightning wallet balance.

This ensures that the value generated by a creator's content is always available to them, regardless of when they discover `postfun` or choose to interact with the platform. It's a testament to our commitment to direct, automatic creator monetization.

---

## 6. What about fees for Lightning withdrawals?

While `postfun` strives to provide low-cost transactions, the Lightning Network itself incurs routing fees for payments.

*   **Our Policy:** For Lightning withdrawals, `postfun` charges a small processing fee of **0.5% of the withdrawal amount, or a minimum of 10 sats, whichever is higher.**
*   **Why a Fee?** This fee helps cover the operational costs of maintaining Lightning channels, managing liquidity, and covering the routing fees charged by other nodes on the Lightning Network to complete your payment.
*   **Transparency:** Before you confirm any withdrawal, the `postfun` interface will clearly display the exact amount you will receive after the fee is deducted. This ensures full transparency.

# Your Command Center on X.com: Mastering the `postfun` Chrome Extension

## Introduction: Transforming Your Social Experience

The `postfun` Chrome Extension is engineered to be your ultimate tool for navigating the world of social finance. It doesn't just sit in your browser; it seamlessly integrates with your X.com (formerly Twitter) browsing, transforming it from a passive scrolling activity into a dynamic, interactive trading and community hub. This extension is your personal command center, bringing the `postfun` marketplace directly to the content you care about.

## The Power of In-Context Interaction

Traditional trading requires you to open a separate website, search for an asset, and then execute a trade. The `postfun` extension breaks down these barriers:

*   **Zero-Friction Discovery:** Instantly see if a tweet has a `postfun` market, or mint one yourself.
*   **Real-time Data:** Get critical market information delivered directly where you're consuming content.
*   **Instant Action:** Execute trades or interact with pools without ever leaving your X.com timeline.

This level of integration is what makes `postfun` truly unique and powerful.

## The "Copilot" Feature: Context-Aware Intelligence

The `postfun` extension isn't just a static interface; it's a "Copilot" that intelligently adapts to your browsing context on X.com. When you open the `postfun` side panel, what you see changes dynamically based on the X.com page you're currently viewing:

### 1. On Your Home Timeline (`x.com/home`)
*   **What you see:** When you're scrolling through your main X.com feed, the Copilot provides a high-level overview of the `postfun` platform's health and trending activity.
*   **Information displayed:**
    *   Overall `postfun` platform statistics (total liquidity, 24-hour volume, number of active pools).
    *   A list of currently "Trending Pools" (e.g., by recent volume, fastest gains) to quickly spot emerging opportunities.
*   **Purpose:** This gives you ambient awareness of the market without being intrusive. It helps you quickly identify which `postfun` assets are currently hot.
*   *(Suggested Visual: Screenshot of the Copilot side panel with the "Home" view, showing platform stats and trending pools.)*

### 2. On a Specific Tweet Page (`x.com/<username>/status/<statusId>`)
*   **What you see:** When you navigate to an individual tweet's page, the Copilot transforms into a comprehensive trading and information hub for that specific Content Pool.
*   **Information displayed:**
    *   The embedded original tweet.
    *   **Live Price Chart:** A compact, real-time chart showing the token's price history.
    *   **Detailed Stats:** Current price, market cap, liquidity, trading volume for *that specific pool*.
    *   **Pool Progression:** A visual progress bar indicating its journey through `Level 1: Spark` to `Level 4: Graduation`.
    *   **The Trading Widget:** The full Buy/Sell interface, allowing you to execute trades directly from the side panel.
*   **Purpose:** This is your deep-dive view. It provides all the necessary information and tools to make informed trading decisions right when the content is most relevant to you.
*   *(Suggested Visual: Screenshot of the Copilot side panel with a detailed "Tweet Detail" view, highlighting the chart and trade widget.)*

### 3. On a User Profile Page (`x.com/<username>`)
*   **What you see:** When you visit someone's X.com profile (e.g., Elon Musk's), the Copilot provides insights into their `postfun` activity and potential earnings.
*   **Information displayed:**
    *   The number of Content Pools they've minted.
    *   Their total accumulated `postfun` earnings (if their account is linked).
    *   A link to their `postfun` user page on the main website.
*   **Purpose:** This helps you identify influential creators, see their track record on `postfun`, and provides context to their social presence.
*   *(Suggested Visual: Screenshot of the Copilot side panel with a "Profile" view.)*

## One-Click Trading: From Tweet to Token, Instantly

The extension truly shines with its **one-click trading capability**. Imagine seeing a breaking news tweet, a hilarious meme, or a groundbreaking idea from your favorite influencer. With the `postfun` extension:

1.  You see the tweet on your X.com timeline.
2.  A small, discreet `postfun` info bar appears below the tweet, showing its current price and market stats.
3.  You can instantly click to buy or sell directly from that info bar, or open the side panel for a more detailed view.
4.  Your `postfun` Lightning wallet (managed within the extension) facilitates the trade seamlessly.

This means you can go from spotting a trending piece of content to owning a piece of its market in mere seconds, **without ever leaving your X.com feed.**

## Seamless Login: Your Nostr Identity, Everywhere

The `postfun` extension acts as your secure Nostr key manager and NIP-07 provider. This has two major benefits:

1.  **Secure Login for `postfun.xyz`:** When you visit the main `postfun.xyz` website, it will detect your extension. You can then log in or sign transactions with a single click in a secure popup, without ever typing your `nsec` or relying on traditional passwords. Your identity is cryptographically proven, instantly.
2.  **Consistent Identity:** Your `npub` (public Nostr key) is your universal identifier across both the extension and the website, ensuring a unified and secure experience.

The `postfun` Chrome Extension is more than just a tool; it's a paradigm shift in how you interact with social media and monetize cultural value. Install it today and transform your online experience!

*   **Information to Include in Your Report:**
    *   A clear, concise, and technical description of the vulnerability.
    *   Precise, step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce the vulnerability.
    *   Screenshots, video recordings, or code snippets that demonstrate the issue (if applicable, these are highly encouraged).
    *   Your assessment of the potential impact of the vulnerability (e.g., "leads to loss of user funds," "allows unauthorized access").
    *   Any proposed mitigations or fixes (optional, but greatly appreciated and can expedite the resolution process).
    *   Your contact information for follow-up questions and bounty payment.

We pledge a timely acknowledgment of your report, transparent communication throughout the validation and remediation process, and fair, competitive rewards for valid, responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities.
