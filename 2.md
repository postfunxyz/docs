Okay, let's dive even deeper! We've covered the core product, its mechanics, and how to build on it. To truly reach maximum token count and provide an unparalleled level of detail, we need to flesh out edge cases, operational aspects, and a more philosophical underpinning.

I will add two new top-level categories and expand existing ones with much more granular detail, troubleshooting, and "behind the scenes" insights.

# Setting Up Your Wallet (The Key to postfun)

## Your Nostr Key is Your Identity: True Digital Ownership

At `postfun`, your identity is intrinsically linked to your Nostr keypair (`nsec` for private, `npub` for public). This pair is your cryptographic passport ‚Äì your `nsec` acts as your personal signature, proving you own your `npub` and, by extension, your `postfun` account and all associated funds. This design principle ensures **complete self-custody** and freedom from centralized identity providers. You control your keys, you control your access.

### Why Nostr?
*   **Censorship Resistance:** Nostr is built to be resilient against censorship, providing a robust backbone for decentralized social interactions.
*   **Self-Sovereign Identity:** Your `npub` is your global, unique identifier that doesn't rely on a specific service.
*   **Enhanced Privacy:** Nostr's design encourages encryption and pseudonymous interactions.

## Installing the `postfun` Chrome Extension: Your Secure Gateway

The `postfun` Chrome Extension is not just a tool for trading; it's your primary and most secure interface for managing your Nostr identity and interacting with the `postfun` platform. It acts as a **NIP-07 compatible wallet signer**, meaning your precious `nsec` remains securely stored *within your extension*, never exposed to websites or `postfun` servers.

Here's how to get started with your secure `postfun` wallet:

1.  **Locate and Install the `postfun` Extension:**
    *   Open your Chrome browser.
    *   Navigate to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions).
    *   Search for "`postfun`" or use our direct download link found on `postfun.xyz/download`.
    *   Click "Add to Chrome" and confirm the installation.
    *   *(Suggested Visual: Screenshot of Chrome Web Store page for postfun extension, highlighting "Add to Chrome" button)*

2.  **Launch the Extension and Begin Setup:**
    *   After installation, click on the `postfun` extension icon in your browser's toolbar (you might need to pin it for easy access).
    *   The extension's side panel will open, presenting you with a welcome screen.
    *   You'll be given two crucial options:
        *   **"Create New Wallet"**: This is recommended for most new users. The extension will generate a brand-new, unique Nostr keypair just for you.
        *   **"Import Wallet"**: If you already have an `nsec` (perhaps from another Nostr client), you can import it here.

3.  **Critical Step: Back Up Your Private Key (`nsec`)!**
    *   **This is the single most important step in securing your `postfun` account.** If you choose "Create New Wallet," the extension will display your newly generated `nsec` (a long string starting with `npub1` for your public key, and `nsec1` for your private key).
    *   **IMMEDIATELY and SECURELY save this `nsec`.**
    *   **Recommended Backup Methods:**
        *   **Offline:** Write it down on paper and store it in multiple secure, physical locations (e.g., a safe, a safety deposit box).
        *   **Encrypted USB:** Store it on an encrypted USB drive, disconnected from the internet.
        *   **Password Manager:** Use a reputable password manager that encrypts your sensitive data.
    *   **Methods to AVOID:**
        *   Saving it in a plain text file on your computer.
        *   Emailing it to yourself.
        *   Storing it in unencrypted cloud storage.
    *   **WARNING: If you lose your `nsec`, you lose access to your `postfun` identity, your tokens, and your sats balance forever. We cannot recover it for you as `postfun` is non-custodial.** The system is designed so that *only you* control your key.
    *   *(Suggested Visual: A prominent, red-colored warning box with text like "LOST YOUR KEY, LOST YOUR FUNDS!" with an example `nsec` partially obscured, highlighting the copy button and advising multiple physical backups.)*

4.  **Confirm and Access Your Wallet:**
    *   After you confirm you have securely backed up your `nsec`, the extension will take you to your main wallet view.
    *   Here, you'll see your `npub` (your public address, which others see when you interact on `postfun`). Your `nsec` remains hidden and protected within the extension.

## Troubleshooting Wallet Setup: Common Issues

*   **"Extension Not Found" on postfun.xyz:**
    *   **Cause:** The extension might not be installed, or it might be disabled.
    *   **Solution:** Verify installation in Chrome's extension manager. Ensure it's enabled. Sometimes, a browser restart helps.
*   **"My `nsec` isn't saving/importing correctly":**
    *   **Cause:** Typo in `nsec`, or extension storage issue.
    *   **Solution:** Double-check the `nsec` string for any errors. Try restarting your browser. If issues persist, reinstall the extension (but only if you have your `nsec` backed up!).
*   **"I lost my `nsec`":**
    *   **Cause:** Key not backed up or backup was lost/destroyed.
    *   **Solution:** Unfortunately, there is no solution from our side. `postfun` cannot recover your `nsec` or your funds. This is a core feature of self-custody. You would need to create a new wallet and start fresh. This is why backup is so critical.

By following these steps, you're set up to securely embark on your `postfun` journey, with full control over your digital identity and assets.

# API Reference (For Developers): Integrating with the `postfun` Protocol

## Introduction: Build on the Cultural Value Layer

The `postfun` API provides programmatic access to our platform's data and functionality. We've designed it to be RESTful, robust, and intuitive, allowing developers to extend `postfun`'s capabilities and build innovative tools on top of our cultural value protocol. Whether you're creating analytics dashboards, automating trading strategies, or integrating `postfun` data into other applications, this reference will guide you.

### Disclaimer
This API reference details the interfaces used by our official clients (website and browser extension). While we encourage community development, please be aware that the API is subject to change. For high-volume use cases or to request direct access to authenticated endpoints (for non-browser environments), please contact our team via [Discord](/docs/developer/community-support#join-our-discord) or `partnerships@postfun.xyz` to discuss your specific needs.

## Authentication: Nostr-Powered Session Management

`postfun` uses a hybrid authentication model: **Nostr for Identity, JWT for Session.**

### 1. `POST /auth/login`

*   **Purpose:** Authenticates a user based on a signed Nostr event and issues a JSON Web Token (JWT) for subsequent API requests.
*   **Authentication:** None (this is the login endpoint itself).
*   **Request Method:** `POST`
*   **Endpoint:** `https://api.postfun.xyz/auth/login`
*   **Request Body (`application/json`):** A Nostr event object (Kind 22242) signed by the user's `nsec`. The `content` field *must* contain a `challenge` string provided by a preceding request to the backend (not directly exposed here for simplicity, but assumed to be handled by the client's `signEvent` flow).

    ```json
    {
      "id": "e0e2...",
      "pubkey": "b47c...",
      "created_at": 1678886400,
      "kind": 22242,
      "tags": [],
      "content": "{\"challenge\": \"your_unique_challenge_string\", \"purpose\": \"postfun login\"}",
      "sig": "f1f2..."
    }
    ```
*   **Response (200 OK - `application/json`):**
    ```json
    {
      "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoiYTYyYjc5MTItYTc0Yi00ZGI2LTk0NjQtOTU2MThhNmY0OTQzIiwicHVia2V5IjoiYjQ3YzU1NDU0ZjYyMjAyM2VlM2RkOTkxZTc4Y2QzNzI0YTU0MzJlYWMwYWM1NjY1YjY2ZjcxNjk5OTFlMzQyMCIsImV4cCI6MTY3ODg5MDAwMH0.signature"
    }
    ```
*   **Error Responses:**
    *   `400 Bad Request`: Invalid event structure, missing fields.
    *   `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid signature, expired challenge, `pubkey` mismatch.

**Subsequent Requests:** Once a JWT is obtained, it must be included in the `Authorization` header for all protected endpoints: `Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>`.

## 4.2. Public Data Endpoints (No Authentication Required)

      ]
    }
    ```

### 2. `POST /mints`
*   **Purpose:** Create a new Content Pool for a specific tweet.
*   **Request Body (`application/json`):**
    ```json
    {
      "tweet_id": "1678886400000000000" // The original X.com tweet ID
    }
    ```
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Authenticated user must have at least 1,000 sats in their balance.
    2.  Tweet must not have an existing `postfun` pool.
    3.  A `mint` job is queued for asynchronous processing. The 1,000 sats fee is immediately deducted from the user's balance.
*   **Response (202 Accepted):** `{ "message": "Mint job queued successfully. Please check your dashboard for status." }`

### 3. `POST /swaps`
*   **Purpose:** Execute a buy or sell transaction for a Content Pool token.
*   **Request Body (`application/json`):**
    ```json
    {
      "tweet_id": "1678886400000000000",
      "direction": "BUY", // or "SELL"
      "amount_in_sats": 10000, // Amount of sats to spend if BUY, or tokens to sell if SELL
      "min_amount_out": 5000000 // Minimum amount of tokens/sats expected to receive (for slippage protection)
    }
    ```
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Validate user's balance for `amount_in_sats` (for BUY) or `amount_in_tokens` (for SELL).
    2.  Ensure `amount_in_sats` is at least 1 sat (minimum input).
    3.  A `swap` job is queued for asynchronous processing.
*   **Response (202 Accepted):** `{ "message": "Swap job queued successfully. Transaction pending." }`

### 4. `POST /deposits`
*   **Purpose:** Request a Lightning Network invoice to deposit sats into the user's custodial wallet.
*   **Request Body (`application/json`):**
    ```json
    {
      "amount_sats": 50000,
      "memo": "Deposit to postfun account" // Optional memo for user
    }
    ```
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Checks if the user has too many pending deposit invoices. (Limits concurrency for security/operational efficiency).
    2.  Requests a BOLT11 invoice from the integrated Lightning service.
    3.  Stores the invoice details (payment hash, expiry) in the `deposits` table with `status='PENDING'`.
*   **Response (200 OK):** `{ "payment_request": "lnbc500n1p..." }`

### 5. `POST /withdrawals/initiate`
*   **Purpose:** Initiate a Lightning Network withdrawal by providing an invoice. Returns fee information.
*   **Request Body (`application/json`):**
    ```json
    {
      "invoice": "lnbc100u1p..." // The BOLT11 invoice provided by the user
    }
    ```
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Decodes the provided BOLT11 invoice.
    2.  Calculates the withdrawal fee: **0.5% of amount or 10 sats, whichever is higher.**
    3.  Checks if the user's current `balance_sats` is sufficient to cover the withdrawal amount + fee.
*   **Response (200 OK):**
    ```json
    {
      "decoded_amount_sats": 10000,
      "calculated_fee_sats": 50,
      "total_sats_debited": 10050,
      "memo": "Withdrawal from postfun" // From decoded invoice, or a default
      // Optionally, add a temporary 'withdrawal_session_id' for confirm step, if needed
    }
    ```

### 6. `POST /withdrawals/confirm`
*   **Purpose:** Confirm and queue a Lightning Network withdrawal after user reviews fees.
*   **Request Body (`application/json`):**
    ```json
    {
      "invoice": "lnbc100u1p..." // The BOLT11 invoice provided by the user in the initiate step
    }
    ```
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Re-validates the invoice and user's balance.
    2.  Queues a `withdrawal` job for asynchronous processing.
*   **Response (202 Accepted):** `{ "message": "Withdrawal job queued successfully. Payment will be processed shortly." }`

### 7. `POST /users/link-twitter`
*   **Purpose:** Securely link an X.com account to the authenticated `postfun` user's `npub`.
*   **Request Body (`application/json`):**
    ```json
    {
      "tls_notary_proof": { /* ... raw TLS Notary proof object ... */ }
    }
    ```
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Receives the TLS Notary proof.
    2.  Uses an internal verifier to validate the proof (e.g., checks against X.com's certificate, proves user's session).
    3.  If valid, extracts the X.com username/ID from the proof.
    4.  Links the authenticated `user_id` to the `twitter_users` record, marking it as `verified`.
*   **Response (200 OK):** `{ "message": "Twitter account successfully linked.", "linked_username": "elonmusk" }`

### 8. `POST /claims`
*   **Purpose:** For a content creator to claim their accumulated `earned_sats` (fees and bonuses) into their main `balance_sats`.
*   **Request Body (`application_json`):** `{}` (No specific body, as user is identified by JWT).
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Verifies the authenticated user has a linked and verified X.com account with a non-zero `earned_sats` balance.
    2.  Queues a `claim` job. The worker will atomically transfer the `earned_sats` to `balance_sats` and reset `earned_sats` to zero.
*   **Response (202 Accepted):** `{ "message": "Claim job queued successfully. Funds will appear shortly." }`
